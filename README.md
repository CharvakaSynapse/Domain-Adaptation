# Office-31 Domain Adaptation with CDAN and Semi-Supervised Enhancements

This notebook demonstrates progressive improvements in **unsupervised domain adaptation** on the Office-31 dataset using PyTorch, from the CDAN baseline to advanced semi-supervised techniques.

## üìö What‚Äôs Inside

- **CDAN (Conditional Domain Adversarial Network)** baseline
- **Class-Balanced Curriculum Pseudo-Labeling** for target domain
- **Consistency Regularization** with strong/weak augmentation and KL loss

All code, explanations, and results are contained in the notebook:  
> **`DANN_DA_FINAL.ipynb`**

| Method                                                            | Test Accuracy (%) |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| CDAN Baseline                                                     | 86.32             |
| CDAN + Class-Balanced Curriculum Pseudo-Labeling                  | 87.39             |
| CDAN + Pseudo-Labeling + Consistency Regularization (Strong/Weak) | **89.10**         |

## üìù Method Highlights

- **CDAN**: Aligns source and target domains with a conditional domain discriminator.
- **Pseudo-Labeling**: Uses curriculum learning and class balancing to safely leverage unlabeled target data.
- **Consistency Regularization**: Enforces prediction agreement between strong and weak augmentations of target images (inspired by FixMatch).

**Total loss:**
\[
L_{total} = L_{cls} + \lambda L_{domain} + \eta L_{entropy} + \beta L_{pseudo} + \gamma L_{cons}
\]
where each term encourages robust, transferable representations.
